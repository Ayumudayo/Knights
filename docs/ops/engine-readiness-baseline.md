# Engine Readiness Baseline Checkpoints

This document is the tracked checkpoint ledger for the `engine-readiness-baseline` branch.

The detailed working runbooks and raw artifact notes live under local-only `tasks/` and ignored `build/engine-readiness/`.
This file exists so each executed checkpoint can leave a commit-visible summary.

## Current Rule

- Execute checkpoints strictly in runbook order.
- Keep each completed checkpoint small enough to be committed independently.
- Use the run root under `build/engine-readiness/<run_id>/` as the raw evidence bundle for the matching checkpoint summary here.

## Phase 3 Checkpoints

| Order | Checkpoint | Run Root | Verdict | Key Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Control baseline rerun | `build/engine-readiness/20260312-0228-control-baseline/` | pass | TCP/UDP/RUDP control comparator stayed clean enough to begin failure/recovery rehearsals. |
| 2 | Redis outage/recovery | `build/engine-readiness/20260314-0150-redis-recovery/` | pass with caveat | gateway/server degraded visibly and recovered automatically; worker Redis outage signaling stayed weaker than gateway/server signaling. |
| 3 | Postgres outage/recovery | `build/engine-readiness/20260314-0155-postgres-recovery/` | pass | server/worker advertised DB degradation cleanly, worker retry/reconnect signals were explicit, and recovery completed automatically. |
| 4 | gateway restart during live traffic | `build/engine-readiness/20260314-0212-gateway-restart/` | pass with caveat | stack recovered and new traffic stayed routable, but the live soak recorded `24` disconnects / `24` errors for sessions on the restarted gateway. |
| 5 | server restart during live traffic | `build/engine-readiness/20260314-0216-server-restart/` | pass with caveat | stack recovered and probes kept passing, but the live soak recorded `26` disconnects / `26` errors for sessions routed to the restarted backend. |
| 6 | worker restart during backlog processing | `build/engine-readiness/20260314-0219-worker-restart/` | pass with caveat | user-facing chat stayed clean and the worker drained backlog after restart, but backlog visibility came from flush logs more than from `wb_pending`/ready metrics. |
| 7 | overload/backpressure rehearsal | `build/engine-readiness/20260314-0223-overload-rehearsal/` | fail | `192` connected sessions produced `156` login failures, while the intended gateway queue/circuit counters stayed flat and did not explain the overload path. |

## Active Caveats

- Redis outage signaling from `wb_worker` is weaker than the gateway/server story in the sampled window.
- Gateway restart currently causes bounded session loss rather than transparent continuity for in-flight sessions behind the restarted instance.
- Server restart currently causes bounded backend-session loss rather than transparent continuity for in-flight sessions routed through the restarted instance.
- Worker restart recovery is visible, but backlog depth signaling is still weaker than ideal because `wb_pending` did not spike in the sampled window.
- Higher concurrent chat load triggers bounded but poorly explained login collapse; the current backpressure metrics do not expose the dominant failure path clearly enough.

## Current Decision

- `ready to branch`: no
- `reason`: overload/backpressure remains a common blocker, and worker Redis degraded-state visibility still needs tightening
- detailed Phase 4 decision: `docs/ops/engine-readiness-decision.md`
- Phase 5 branch-cut criteria: `docs/ops/engine-branch-cut-criteria.md`
- preferred first branch once the baseline closes: `engine-roadmap-mmorpg`

## Next Checkpoint

- `common blocker remediation before any branch cut`
